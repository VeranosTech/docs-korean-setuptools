"Before authoring any source code, it's often prudent to file a ticket "
"describing the motivation behind making changes. First search to see if a"
" ticket already exists for your issue. If not, create one. Try to think "
"from the perspective of the reader. Explain what behavior you expected, "
"what you got instead, and what factors might have contributed to the "
"unexpected behavior. In Github, surround a block of code or traceback "
"with the triple backtick \"\\`\\`\\`\" so that it is formatted nicely."

"Filing a ticket provides a forum for justification, discussion, and "

"the way it does or why certain changes were made."
