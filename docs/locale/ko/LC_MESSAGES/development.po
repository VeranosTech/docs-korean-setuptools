"This document describes the process by which Setuptools is developed. "
"This document assumes the reader has some passing familiarity with "
"*using* setuptools, the ``pkg_resources`` module, and EasyInstall.  It "
"does not attempt to explain basic concepts like inter-project "
"dependencies, nor does it contain detailed lexical syntax for most file "
"formats.  Neither does it explain concepts like \"namespace packages\" or"
" \"resources\" in any detail, as all of these subjects are covered at "
"length in the setuptools developer's guide and the ``pkg_resources`` "
"reference manual."

"Instead, this is **internal** documentation for how those concepts and "
"features are *implemented* in concrete terms.  It is intended for people "
"who are working on the setuptools code base, who want to be able to "
"troubleshoot setuptools problems, want to write code that reads the file "
"formats involved, or want to otherwise tinker with setuptools-generated "
"files and directories."

"Note, however, that these are all internal implementation details and are"
" therefore subject to change; stick to the published API if you don't "
"want to be responsible for keeping your code from breaking when "
"setuptools changes.  You have been warned."
